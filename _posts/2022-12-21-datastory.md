The last decade has been marked by emancipating and feminist movements. While many inequalities subsist to this day, women’s rights have progressed, along with mentalities. In this context, one could assess if before the last decade, a trend of improved women’s representation was translated in the film industry during the last fifty to a hundred years, and how this representation itself has evolved (i.e., the way women are depicted, and their relative importance compared to male characters). Firstly, it would be interesting to study women’s representation across many movies using different characteristics throughout the last century, combining meta-datas about the movies, their characters, and their summaries’ language analysis. Then, one could study in more detail and compare different movie genres to further gain insight on women’s representation and evaluate its homogeneity across the film industry. Lastly, one could use the movies’ countries of origin to assess progress in this representation in different world regions.


##### Global representation of women in the movie industry

Before digging in the depth of the movies industry, our first step is to look at the global representation of women, and its evolution accross decades. To set the stage, it is interesting to look at roles repartition between men and women, first in the whole dataset, and then across time :

As we can see, there is a clear difference in roles repartition, it is thus interesting to see how this inequality distributes across decades :
